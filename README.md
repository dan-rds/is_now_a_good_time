# Is Now A Good Time? :telephone_receiver: :arrow_right: :telephone_receiver: :alarm_clock: ?
Ever get sick of googling "time in berlin" or "time in california" 
just to see if your lover is awake and might beready for a call? 
Now you dont have to!

This **GROUND BREAKING** script translates timezones and prints the result and the 
translation table along with a column that lets you know if it's a 
good time to call. In other words, it tells you if it's not between 12 am and 7 am for either 
you or your lover. :kissing_heart: 

Clone and cd into the folder then run 
```
./is_now_a_good_time.py
```
